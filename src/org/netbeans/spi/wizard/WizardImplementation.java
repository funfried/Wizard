/**
 * <b>Note:</b>It is quite rare to need to directly implement this interface.
 * Typically you will deal with it if you are implementing a UI to <i>display</i>
 * wizards;  otherwise what you probably want to do is use one of the 
 * convenience classes that handles the navigation logic.
 * <p>
 * If you want to create a Wizard with a fixed set of steps, use
 * {@link org.netbeans.spi.wizard.WizardPage WizardPage} or 
 * implement
 * {@link org.netbeans.spi.wizard.WizardPanelProvider WizardPanelProvider}
 * and call {@link org.netbeans.spi.wizard.WizardPanelProvider#createWizard 
 * createWizard} on it.
 * <p>
 * If you have a wizard that has choice-points, where depending on what the
 * user chooses on one pane, the subsequent number or set of panes will change, implement
 * <code>{@link org.netbeans.spi.wizard.WizardBranchController WizardBranchController}</code> to supply different sub-wizards 
 * depending on the user's choices, and call {@link org.netbeans.spi.wizard.WizardBranchController#createWizard createWizard}
 * to get the result.  <code>{@link org.netbeans.spi.wizard.WizardBranchController WizardBranchController}</code>
 * will let you provide a choice of {@link org.netbeans.spi.wizard.WizardPanelProvider WizardPanelProvider}s
 * depending on what the user enters.  For most cases no more is needed.
 * <p>
 * To display any <code>Wizard</code> to the user, call 
 * {@link org.netbeans.api.wizard.WizardDisplayer#show WizardDisplayer.show 
 * (someWizard)}
 * <p>
 * The one case in which it may be necessary to implement this interface 
 * directly is if you have a Wizard that for some reason needs to disable
 * the <code>Prev</code> button (this is not a good idea from a usability
 * standpoint).  For all other cases, consider using one of <code>WizardPage</code>,
 * <code>WizardPanelProvider</code> and/or <code>WizardBranchController</code> - 
 * they are much simpler to work with.
 * <hr>
 * <p>
 * This class is the Wizard interface - a Wizard is a series of one or more steps represented
 * by panels in the user interface.  Each step is identified by a String ID.
 * For each ID, the <code>navigatedTo()</code> method supplies a component to
 * be displayed to the user.
 * <p>
 * Each panel may add wizardData to a Map, which is passed to <code>navigatedTo()</code>.
 * At the conclusion of a Wizard (if/when the user presses the <code>Finish</code>
 * button), the method <code>finish (Map wizardData)</code> is invoked, and the
 * Wizard may instantiate whatever it needs to and return that.  It is up to
 * the caller to do something with the return value.
 * <p>
 * Wizards should never make any changes to their environment except in the
 * <code>finish()</code> method - until that is called, they should simply
 * collect information.
 * <p>
 * The IDs of steps of the wizard should be returned by the method
 * <code>getAllIDs()</code>.  If a Wizard contains <i>branching</i>, such
 * that all of the steps cannot be determined, it should return an array
 * of Strings terminated with the special ID <code>UNDETERMINED_STEP</code>;
 * as the set of following steps becomes known, it should fire <code>
 * stepsChange()</code> to any registered WizardListeners.
