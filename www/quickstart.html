A wizard is a thing with a series of panels;  each panel gathers some settings
from the user, and puts them in a <code>java.util.Map</code>.  When the user clicks
the <b>Finish</b> button, your code will be passed that <code>Map</code>, to create some
object based on the user's input, or do whatever your wizard is supposed to do.
<p>
The simplest way to get started is to use 
<a href="nonav/javadoc/org/netbeans/spi/wizard/WizardPage.html"></a><code>WizardPage</code></a>.
This is a GUI panel with some clever behavior to make it easy to write things
into the <code>Map</code>.  Simply add components to a <code>WizardPage</code>,
setting the <i>name</i> property of each component.  For standard Swing 
components, <code>WizardPage</code> will automatically listen to them, detect
input, and store that data in the <code>Map</code>, using the component's name
as the key.  So creating a page in a wizard is as simple as:
<pre>
    Container page = new WizardPage ("step1", "Do the first step");
    JTextField input = new JTextField();
    <font color="gray">//Be sure to set the name before you add it to the WizardPage</font>
    input.setName (&quot;input&quot;);
    page.add (input);
</pre>
When the types into <code>input</code>, whatever the text is will automatically
be put into the settings map.  This will also work for components in sub-panels
you put inside  <code>WizardPage</code> (but in all cases, the <i>name</i> property
of each component must be set before it is added!).
<p>
To actually show a wizard in a dialog, just use one of the static methods on
<code>WizardPage</code> to create an instance of <code>Wizard</code> which you
can pass to the default <code>WizardDisplayer</code>, which is responsible for
showing a wizard dialog.
<pre>
        Wizard wiz = 
                WizardPage.createWizard(new Class[] { 
                <font color="gray">//Both of these classes are subclasses of 
                //WizardPage.  We could also pass instances of WizardPage.</font>
                    FirstPage.class, SecondPage.class });
        
        Map gatheredSettings = (Map) WizardDisplayer.showWizard(wiz));
</pre>
<p>
To compute some result at the end of the <code>Wizard</code>, simply implement
<a href="nonav/javadoc/org/netbeans/spi/wizard/WizardPage.WizardResultProducer.html">
<code>WizardPage.WizardResultProducer</code></a>. Implement it to 
compute the resulting object that is the output of the wizard
(or write files to disk or do whatever is supposed to be done at the conclusion
of your wizard).  If you do not pass a <code>WizardResultProducer</code>, then
the <code>Map</code> of all gathered settings is returned from
<code>WizardDisplayer.showWizard()</code>:
<pre>
<font color="gray">//...</font>
Wizard wiz = WizardPage.createWizard(
        new Class[] { 
            FirstPage.class, SecondPage.class }, 
        <b>new MyResultProducer()</b>
    );
                    
<font color="gray">//...</font>

class MyResultProducer implements WizardResultProducer {
    public Object finish(Map wizardData) throws WizardException {
        String nameForThing = (String) wizardData.get ("name");
        Color colorOfThing = (Color) wizardData.get ("color");
        return new Thing (name, color);
    }

    public boolean cancel(Map settings) {
        boolean dialogShouldClose = JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog (null, 
            "Don't you want to create a thing?!!") == JOptionPane.OK_OPTION;
        return dialogShouldClose;
    }
}
</pre>

<h2>Input Validation</h2>
Often wizards will want to restrict input to certain things, or ensure some 
selection has been made.  To do that, simply subclass <code>WizardPage</code>
and override <code>validateContents()</code>.  Just return <code>null</code> if
everything is fine and the Next or Finish buttons should be enabled.  If the
user needs to enter some more or different data, return a String describing 
what the user should do.
<pre>
    protected String validateContents(Component component, Object event) {
        if ((component == input || component == null) && input.getText().trim().length() == 0) {
           return "Enter some text";
        }
        return null;
    }
</pre>
<p>
<h2>Showing a Summary Page</h2>
If you want to show a &quot;summary page&quot; that tells what has been done,
after the user has clicked the <b>Finish</b> button, simply return an instance
of <a href="nonav/javadoc/org/netbeans/spi/wizard/Summary.html">
<code>Summary</code></a> object from your <code>WizardResultProducer</code>'s 
<code>finish()</code> method.  You can pass it a some text to display in a 
text control, or an array of strings to show in a JList, or a component you 
create.  When the user clicks Finish, all of the wizard buttons will become 
disabled except the <b>Cancel</b> button (which now says &quot;Close&quot;),
and the summary will be displayed.

<p>
<h2>Doing Work in the Background</h2>
Sometimes constructing the result of a wizard is expensive - it can involve
doing something with files on disk, or fetching something over the internet or
some other time-consuming task.
<p>
There is a simple way to do this:  Implement 
<a href="nonav/javadoc/org/netbeans/spi/wizard/DeferredWizardResult.html">
<code>DeferredWizardResult</code></a> and return it from
from <code>WizardResultProducer.finish()</code>.  That class has a 
<code>start()</code> method which will be called on a background thread;  you
can do the computation of the result there:
<pre>
    static class BackgroundResultCreator extends DeferredWizardResult {
        public void start(Map wizardData, DeferredWizardResult.ResultProgressHandle progress) {
            assert !EventQueue.isDispatchThread();
            try {
               progress.setProgress ("Doing something", 0, 3);
               doSomethingExpensive (wizardData);
               
               progress.setProgress ("Doing something", 1, 3);
               doSomethingElseExpensive (wizardData);
               
               progress.setProgress ("Doing something", 2, 3);
               Object finalResult = doAnotherExpensiveThing (wizardData);
               
               progress.finish (finalResult);
            } catch (SomeException e) {
               progress.fail (e.getMessage(), false);
            }
        }
</pre>
<p>
If it should be possible for the user to close the dialog while your operation 
is running, pass true to your <code>DeferredWizardResult</code>'s superclass
constructor and implement the <code>abort()</code> method (typically you set
a flag and <code>start()</code> checks that flag periodically and exits 
immediately if it has become <code>true</code>).
<p>
If you want to show a summary page at the end of the wizard, simply call
<code>progress.finish()</code> and pass an instance of <code>Summary</code>
instead of the object (if any) that you computed as a result of the wizard.
You will pass the created object to the <code>Summary</code> constructor, so
that it can be returned from <code>WizardDisplayer.showWizard()</code>.

<h2>Wizards That Change Based On User Input</h2>
While describing the details is out of scope for the quick start guide, if you
want to have, for example, a wizard where the user makes some selection on the
first panel, and depending on that selection, the subsequent steps of the wizard
will change, that is easy to do.  Basically you will implement
<a href="nonav/javadoc/org/netbeans/spi/wizard/WizardBranchController.html">WizardBranchController</a>.
That class has a method which is passed the <code>Map</code> of user input, and 
returns a different <code>Wizard</code> depending on what is in the <code>Map</code>.
Basically branching is nesting wizards within wizards - at each choice point, you
provide a <code>Wizard</code> which defines the subsequent steps.
