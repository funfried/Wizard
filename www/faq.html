<b>Help!  Where do I start?</b>
If you just want to create a simple wizard with a fixed
set of steps, do the following:
<ol>
    <li>Create the panels you want in your favorite Swing GUI builder</li>
    <li>Have them subclass WizardPage</li>
    <li>For each component on each panel that affects what the wizard 
        will do or create, set
        the <code>name</code> of that component to some unique string.</li>
    <li>On each one, add two static methods:
        <ul>
            <li><code>public static String getID()</code> - this should
                return a short unique string that names the step this panel
                represents</li>
            <li><code>public static String getDescription()</code> -
                this should return a <i>localized</i> string that
                describes the step - keep it short.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Implement the one-method interface 
        <code>WizardPage.WizardResultProducer</code>.  It is going to be
        passed a <code>Map</code>, where the keys are the names of your
        components, and the values are the current values in those 
        components (i.e. if a checkbox is checked and has the name "foo",
        if you call <code>get("foo")</code> on the map, you will get
        Boolean.TRUE - all the standard Swing components are handled
        appropriately.</li>
    <li>Do something like: 
        <pre>
            Class[] clazz = new Class[] {
                MyFirstPage.class,
                MySecondPage.class,
                MyThirdPage.class
                };
            WizardResultProducer finishIt = new MyResultProducer();
            Object result = WizardDisplayer.showWizard (
                WizardPage.createWizard(clazz, finishIt));
        </pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<b>How do I disable the next button?</b><br>
Call <code>WizardController.setProblem(&quot;[problem-string]&quot;)</code> on the
<code>WizardController</code> instance that was passed when your panel was
created.  The string that is passed
will appear at the bottom of the wizard.  It should be something that describes
what information is missing or incorrect, and how it is incorrect.
<p>
<b>What is the basis for the ui/button set/the way wizards look?</b> <br>
The Java Look and Feel guidelines for wizards.  A lot of time, expertise and
effort went into figuring out how to create wizards that somebody's
grandmother could use in creating those - experimenting with different
designs and putting real users in front of them.  They are Good Stuff[tm].
<p>
<b>How do I change the background image on the left side of the wizard dialog?</b><br>
Set the system property &quot;wizard.sidebar.image&quot; to a URL that points
to the image file inside a jar that is on the classpath.  The image must be in
a format readable by <code>ImageIO.read()</code>.
<br>

<p>
<b>What is the default image behind the steps on the left side of wizards?</b><br>
It's the standard side panel for wizards in NetBeans - because nobody's gotten
around to replacing it with something more generic.  Contributions are welcome.
<p>
<b>How do I disable the next button without showing a string to the user?</b><br>
First, <i>don't do that.</i>  Even if you think it's
obvious what's wrong, that doesn't mean it will be obvious to the user.  Really.
You are not your target audience (if you were, you wouldn't be writing a wizard).
<p>
Consistency is good.  If whenever something is wrong, some blue text appears in
the wizard, that's an added cue that something is wrong that makes the wizard
easy to use (not to mention that you can tell them how to fix it).  It is 
better for all wizard panels to behave the same way when something is wrong.
Things that silently fail and wizards that can't be completed make people go 
out and download other software that is friendlier.  Seriously.
<p>
Now, if you've read all that and you are <i>absolutely determined</i> to disable
the Next button without telling the user why you're doing that...call 
<code>setProblem(&quot;  &quot;);</code> on the <code>WizardController</code>.
<p>
<b>How do I disable the Prev button?</b><br>
You don't.  There is only one reason for wanting that:  The wizard has done
something irrevocable (changed files on disk, etc.) before the user clicked
finish.  The entire point of this library is to make it easy to create wizards
that <i>never do things like that</i> (as it's a great way to have lots of bugs).
<p>
You can <i>temporarily</i> disable all navigation with 
<code>WizardPanelProvider.setBusy()</code>.  This is for use when, for example,
some lengthy background process is happening and navigation should 
temporarily be disabled while it completes.
<p>
<b>It says the wizard UI is pluggable.  How do I provide my own implementation
of <code>WizardDisplayer</code>?</b><br>
Write an implementation of <code>WizardDisplayer</code> which has a public,
no argument constructor.  Set the system property 
&quot;WizardDisplayer.default&quot; to the fully qualified name of the class.
<p>
<i>This item is subject to change</i><br>
Longer term, it would be nicer to use the NetBeans lookup library to do this - 
then a jar on the classpath just needs to have a file in <code>META-INF/services</code>
naming the class, which is cleaner than doing it programmatically.
<p>
<b>Can I create a wizard with only Next/Prev buttons?</b><br>
Yes, if you provide your own implementation of <code>WizardDisplayer</code>.
<p>
<b>Why are you so persnickity about the UI?</b><br>
Because I'm a cranky curmudgeon.  Next question.
