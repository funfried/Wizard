<b>How do I disable the next button?</b><br>
Call <code>WizardController.setProblem(&quot;[problem-string]&quot;) on the
<code>WizardController</code> instance that was passed when your panel was
created.  The string that is passed
will appear at the bottom of the wizard.  It should be something that describes
what information is missing or incorrect, and how it is incorrect.
<p>
<b>How do I disable the next button but not show any problem text?</b><br>
First, <i>don't do that.</i>  Even if you think it's
obvious what's wrong, that doesn't mean it will be obvious to the user.  Really.
You are not your target audience (if you were, you wouldn't be writing a wizard).
<p>
Consistency is good.  If whenever something is wrong, some blue text appears in
the wizard, that's an added cue that something is wrong that makes the wizard
easy to use (not to mention that you can tell them how to fix it).  It is 
better for all wizard panels to behave the same way when something is wrong.
Things that silently fail and wizards that can't be completed make people go 
out and download other software that is friendlier.  Seriously.
<p>
Now, if you've read all that and you are <i>absolutely determined</i> to disable
the Next button without telling the user why you're doing that...call 
<code>setProblem(&quot;  &quot;);</code> on the <code>WizardController</code>.
<p>
<b>How do I change the background image on the left side of the wizard dialog?</b><br>
Set the system property &quot;wizard.sidebar.image&quot; to a URL that points
to the image file inside a jar that is on the classpath.  The image must be in
a format readable by <code>ImageIO.read()</code>.

<b>It says the wizard UI is pluggable.  How do I provide my own implementation
of <code>WizardDisplayer</code>?</b><br>
Write an implementation of <code>WizardDisplayer</code> which has a public,
no argument constructor.  Set the system property 
&quot;WizardDisplayer.default&quot; to the fully qualified name of the class.

Longer term, it would be nicer to use the NetBeans lookup library to do this - 
then a jar on the classpath just needs to have a file in <code>META-INF/services</code>
naming the class, which is cleaner than doing it programmatically.
