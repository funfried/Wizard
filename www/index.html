Provides a simple API and UI for Wizards, a commonly used UI pattern in GUI 
interfaces. Traditionally, everybody has needed to write their own 
Wizards from scratch, and such code is painful and hard to get right. 
<p>
This 
library aims to provide a simple, relatively bulletproof API 
for writing Wizards.  The UI for Wizards is pluggable;  the default
implementation conforms to the JLF usability guidelines for
Wizards.
<p>
This library was designed as a 
replacement for NetBeans' Wizards API, and takes into account the long history 
of that API, problems encountered with it over the years. It provides a 
simple, easy-to-use solution that enables any Swing application to provide 
Wizards with a minimum of code and effort.
