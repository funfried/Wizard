Provides a simple API and UI for Wizards, a commonly used UI pattern in GUI 
interfaces. Traditionally, everybody has needed to write their own 
Wizards from scratch, and such code is painful and hard to get right. This 
library aims to provide a simple API for writing Wizards, and default UI that 
resembles Wizards in other applications, but with the ability to plug in 
alternative UI implementations if desired. This library was designed as a 
replacement for NetBeans' Wizards API, and takes into account the long history 
of that API, problems encountered with it over the years, and provide a 
simple, easy to use solution that enables any Swing application to provide 
Wizards with a minimum of code and effort.

<p>
The model for a wizard
is a list of String IDs, which a user-supplied factory can map back to panels and 
human-readable descriptions.  As much of the management of panels and IDs as possible is handled
automatically. Decision points at which the list of future steps change and wizards with
an indeterminite number of steps are supported.  User supplied panels collect data from the
user, which is placed into a <code>Map</code> which will be used to do whatever the wizard 
does when <code>finish()</code> is called.  Removal of map entries when the user navigates 
backward in a wizard is handled automatically. 
<p>
Creating a wizard can be as simple as extending <code>WizardPanelProvider</code>, passing an
array of step IDs and implementing <code>createPanel</code> and <code>Finish</code>.  Then just
call <code>WizardDisplayer.showWizard(myPanelProvider.createWizard())</code>.  Essentially
you implement something like this:
<p>
<pre>
    protected JComponent createPanel(WizardController wc, String step, Map data) {
        System.err.println("CreatePanel " + s);
        if ("step1".equals(step)) {
            wc.setProblem(null);
            return new Panel1(data, wc);
        } else if ("step2".equals(step)) {
            wc.setProblem ("Select a doohickey");
            return new Panel2(data, wc);
        } else if ("step3".equals(step)) {
            ...
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(step);
        }
    }    
</pre>    
The panels typically will use the WizardController to enable/disable navigation
depending on the state of the controls, and write data into the map to be 
used by the <code>finish()</code> method or other panels.
<p>
A basic UI/implementation of <code>WizardDisplayer</code> is provided; the
implementation of <code>WizardDisplayer</code> is pluggable, so applications can provide a 
completely different UI if desired.
<p>
<b>To Do:</b><br>
<ul><li>Add support for post-finish summary panels per the JLF spec</li>
<li>Localize <code>TrivialWizardDisplayer</code></li>
</ul>
