Provides a simple API and UI for Wizards, a commonly used UI pattern in GUI interfaces. Traditionally, everybody has needed to write their own Wizards, and such code is painful and hard to get right. This library aims to provide a simple API for writing Wizards, and default UI that resembles Wizards in other applications, but with the ability to plug in alternative UI implementations if desired. This library was designed as a replacement for NetBeans' Wizards API, and takes into account the long history of that API, problems encountered with it over the years, and provide a simple, easy to use solution that enables any Swing application to provide Wizards with a minimum of code and effort.

<p>
This library aims to allow someone to implement a Wizard with minimal code.  The model for a wizard
is essentially a list of String IDs, which a user-supplied factory can map back to panels and 
human-readable descriptions.  As much of the management of panels and IDs as possible is handled
automatically. Decision points at which the list of future steps change are supported.
<p>
Creating a wizard can be as simple as extending <code>WizardPanelProvider</code>, passing an
array of step IDs and implementing <code>createPanel</code> and <code>Finish</code>.  Then just
call <code>WizardDisplayer.show(myPanelProvider.createWizard())</code>.
<p>
A basic UI/implementation of <code>WizardDisplayer</code> is provided (needs polish); the
implementation of <code>WizardDisplayer</code> is pluggable, so applications can provide a 
completely different UI if desired.
<p>
<b>To Do:</b><br>
<ul><li>Add support for post-finish summary panels per the JLF spec</li>
<li>Localize and possibly improve <code>TrivialWizardDisplayer</code></li>
</ul>
