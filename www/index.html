Provides a simple API and UI for Wizards, a commonly used UI pattern in GUI 
interfaces. Traditionally, everybody has needed to write their own 
Wizards from scratch, and such code is painful and hard to get right. 
<p>
This 
library aims to provide a simple, relatively bulletproof API 
for writing Wizards.  The UI for Wizards is pluggable;  the default
implementation conforms to the JLF usability guidelines for
Wizards.
<p>
This library was designed as a 
replacement for NetBeans' Wizards API, and takes into account the long history 
of that API and problems encountered with it over the years. It provides a 
simple, easy-to-use solution that enables any Swing application to provide 
Wizards with a minimum of code and effort.

<h3>News</h3>
<ul>
<li><i>9/23/06</i>&mdash;WizardPage now listens to nested 
containers so any named component can participate in the wizard settings map with
no code needed.</li>
<li><i>8/20/05</i>&mdash;A convenience class, WizardPage, has been added,
which makes it even easier to create new wizards, often doing almost nothing
but using your favorite GUI designer.  See the first item in the
<a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.</li>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide an easy-to-use API for creating wizards</li>
    <li>Leverage existing research into how to make wizards easy to use 
        for end users</li>
    <li>Leverage knowledge of known problems in existing wizard APIs to
        avoid them in this one</li>
    <li>Make it easy to create wizards that end users find easy to use</li>
    <li>Minimalism - the API should be low-surface-area, exposing
        no more concepts or classes than necessary</li>
    <li>Robustness - keep the code simple and heavily covered by tests</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Status</h3>
<p>
This library has not yet reached 1.0 status (we reserve the right to make
API changes), but is stable in terms
of functionality and used in many projects. If you 
encounter a problem, please file bugs;  bugs with unit tests attached are 
much appreciated.
<h3>To Do:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add support for post-finish summary panels per the JLF spec</li>
<li>Repackage to net.java namespace?</li>
<li>Localize <code>DefaultWizardDisplayer</code></li>
</ul>
