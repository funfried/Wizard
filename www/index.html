Provides a simple API and UI for Wizards, a commonly used UI pattern in GUI 
interfaces. Traditionally, everybody has needed to write their own 
Wizards from scratch, and such code is painful and hard to get right. 
<p>
<!--<img align="right" src="logo.png"/> -->
This 
library aims to provide a simple, relatively bulletproof API 
for writing Wizards.  The UI for Wizards is pluggable;  the default
implementation conforms to the JLF usability guidelines for
Wizards.
<p>
This library was designed as a 
replacement for NetBeans' Wizards API, and takes into account the long history 
of that API, problems encountered with it over the years. It provides a 
simple, easy-to-use solution that enables any Swing application to provide 
Wizards with a minimum of code and effort.

<font color="#4444ff"><i>(new as of 8/20/05)</i> A convenience class, WizardPage, has been added,
which makes it even easier to create new wizards, often doing almost nothing
but using your favorite GUI designer.  See the first item in the
<a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.</font>
